        In a cave water droplets continued falling into a lake from crystals on
        the ceiling cooling the surrounding area. The ground started to rumble
        slowly but it eventually it built up into a devastating earthquake that
        made the shining crystals fall to the ground. The crystals slowly
        gathered as if having a will of their own or more accurately as if being
        pulled by invisible strings to the centre of the cave near the lake.
